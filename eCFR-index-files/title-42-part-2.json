(3) If the cost-sharing amounts are owed to a pharmacy (including, but not limited to, pharmacies of the Indian Health Service, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations) for cost-sharing imposed under a Federal health care program, the pharmacy may reduce or waive the cost-sharing amounts if: (i) The waiver or reduction is not offered as part of an advertisement or solicitation; and (ii) Except for waivers or reductions offered to subsidy-eligible individuals (as defined in section 1860D-14(a)(3)) to which only requirement in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section applies: (A) The pharmacy does not routinely waive or reduce cost-sharing amounts; and (B) The pharmacy waives the cost-sharing amounts only after determining in good faith that the individual is in financial need or after failing to collect the cost-sharing amounts after making reasonable collection efforts.

Marketing and other pre-enrollment activities are not “items or services” for purposes of this section. (u) Price reductions offered by contractors with substantial financial risk to managed care organizations. (1) As used in section 1128(B) of the Act, “remuneration” does not include any payment between: (i) A qualified managed care plan and a first tier contractor for providing or arranging for items or services, where the following five standards are met— (A) The agreement between the qualified managed care plan and first tier contractor must: ( 1 ) Be in writing and signed by the parties; ( 2 ) Specify the items and services covered by the agreement; ( 3 ) Be for a period of a least one year; ( 4 ) Require participation in a quality assurance program that promotes the coordination of care, protects against underutilization and specifies patient goals, including measurable outcomes where appropriate; and ( 5 ) Specify a methodology for determining payment that is commercially reasonable and consistent with fair market value established in an arms-length transaction and includes the intervals at which payments will be made and the formula for calculating incentives and penalties, if any. (B) If a first tier contractor has an investment interest in a qualified managed care plan, the investment interest must meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (C) The first tier contractor must have substantial financial risk for the cost or utilization of services it is obligated to provide through one of the following four payment methodologies: ( 1 ) A periodic fixed payment per patient that does not take into account the dates services are provided, the frequency of services, or the extent or kind of services provided; ( 2 ) Percentage of premium; ( 3 ) Inpatient Federal health care program diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) (other than those for psychiatric services); ( 4 ) Bonus and withhold arrangements, provided— ( i ) The target payment for first tier contractors that are individuals or non-institutional providers is at least 20 percent greater than the minimum payment, and for first tier contractors that are institutional providers, i.e., hospitals and nursing homes, is at least 10 percent greater than the minimum payment; ( ii ) The amount at risk, i.e., the bonus or withhold, is earned by a first tier contractor in direct proportion to the ratio of the contractor's actual utilization to its target utilization; ( iii ) In calculating the percentage in accordance with paragraph (u)(1)(i)(C)( 4 )( i ) of this section, both the target payment amount and the minimum payment amount include any performance bonus, e.g., payments for timely submission of paperwork, continuing medical education, meeting attendance, etc., at a level achieved by 75 percent of the first tier contractors who are eligible for such payments; ( iv ) Payment amounts, including any bonus or withhold amounts, are reasonable given the historical utilization patterns and costs for the same or comparable populations in similar managed care arrangements; and ( v ) Alternatively, for a first tier contractor that is a physician, the qualified managed care plan has placed the physician at risk for referral services in an amount that exceeds the substantial financial risk threshold set forth in 42 CFR 417.479(f) and the arrangement is in compliance with the stop-loss and beneficiary survey requirements of 42 CFR 417.479(g). (D) Payments for items and services reimbursable by Federal health care program must comply with the following two standards— ( 1 ) The qualified managed care plan (or in the case of a self-funded employer plan that contracts with a qualified managed care plan to provide administrative services, the self-funded employer plan) must submit the claims directly to the Federal health care program, in accordance with a valid reassignment agreement, for items or services reimbursed by the Federal health care program. (Notwithstanding the foregoing, inpatient hospital services, other than psychiatric services, will be deemed to comply if the hospital is reimbursed by a Federal health care program under a DRG methodology.) ( 2 ) Payments to first tier contractors and any downstream contractors for providing or arranging for items or services reimbursed by a Federal health care program must be identical to payment arrangements to or between such parties for the same items or services provided to other beneficiaries with similar health status, provided that such payments may be adjusted where the adjustments are related to utilization patterns or costs of providing items or services to the relevant population. (E) In establishing the terms of an arrangement— ( 1 ) Neither party gives or receives remuneration in return for or to induce the provision or acceptance of business (other than business covered by the arrangement) for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a Federal health care program on a fee-for-service or cost basis; and ( 2 ) Neither party to the arrangement shifts the financial burden of such arrangement to the extent that increased payments are claimed from a Federal health care program.

(2) For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms are defined as follows: (i) Downstream contractor means an individual or entity that has a subcontract directly or indirectly with a first tier contractor for the provision or arrangement of items or services that are covered by an agreement between a qualified managed care plan and the first tier contractor. (ii) First tier contractor means an individual or entity that has a contract directly with a qualified managed care plan to provide or arrange for items or services. (iii) Is obligated to provide for a contractor refers to items or services: (A) Provided directly by an individual or entity and its employees; (B) For which an individual or entity is financially responsible, but which are provided by downstream contractors; (C) For which an individual or entity makes referrals or arrangements; or (D) For which an individual or entity receives financial incentives based on its own, its provider group's, or its qualified managed care plan's performance (or combination thereof). (iv) Items and services means health care items, devices, supplies or services or those services reasonably related to the provision of health care items, devices, supplies or services including, but not limited to, non-emergency transportation, patient education, attendant services, social services (e.g., case management), utilization review and quality assurance. Marketing or other pre-enrollment activities are not “items or services” for purposes of this definition in this paragraph. (v) Minimum payment is the guaranteed amount that a provider is entitled to receive under an agreement with a first tier or downstream contractor or a qualified managed care plan. (vi) Qualified managed care plan means a health plan as defined in paragraph (l)(2) of this section that: (A) Provides a comprehensive range of health services; (B) Provides or arranges for— ( 1 ) Reasonable utilization goals to avoid inappropriate utilization; ( 2 ) An operational utilization review program; ( 3 ) A quality assurance program that promotes the coordination of care, protects against underutilization, and specifies patient goals, including measurable outcomes where appropriate; ( 4 ) Grievance and hearing procedures; ( 5 ) Protection of enrollees from incurring financial liability other than copayments and deductibles; and ( 6 ) Treatment for Federal health care program beneficiaries that is not different than treatment for other enrollees because of their status as Federal health care program beneficiaries; and (C) Covers a beneficiary population of which either— ( 1 ) No more than 10 percent are Medicare beneficiaries, not including persons for whom a Federal health care program is the secondary payer; or ( 2 ) No more than 50 percent are Medicare beneficiaries (not including persons for whom a Federal health care program is the secondary payer), provided that payment of premiums is on a periodic basis that does not take into account the dates services are rendered, the frequency of services, or the extent or kind of services rendered, and provided further that such periodic payments for the non-Federal health care program beneficiaries do not take into account the number of Federal health care program fee-for-service beneficiaries covered by the agreement or the amount of services generated by such beneficiaries. (vii) Target payment means the fair market value payment established through arms length negotiations that will be earned by an individual or entity that: (A) Is dependent on the individual or entity's meeting a utilization target or range of utilization targets that are set consistent with historical utilization rates for the same or comparable populations in similar managed care arrangements, whether based on its own, its provider group's or the qualified managed care plan's utilization (or a combination thereof); and (B) Does not include any bonus or fees that the individual or entity may earn from exceeding the utilization target. (v) Ambulance replenishing. (1) As used in section 1128B of the Act, “remuneration” does not include any gift or transfer of drugs or medical supplies (including linens) by a hospital or other receiving facility to an ambulance provider for the purpose of replenishing comparable drugs or medical supplies (including linens) used by the ambulance provider (or a first responder) in connection with the transport of a patient by ambulance to the hospital or other receiving facility if all of the standards in paragraph (v)(2) of this section are satisfied and all of the applicable standards in either paragraph (v)(3)(i), (v)(3)(ii) or (v)(3)(iii) of this section are satisfied. However, to qualify under paragraph (v), the ambulance that is replenished must be used to provide emergency ambulance services an average of three times per week, as measured over a reasonable period of time. Drugs and medical supplies (including linens) initially used by a first responder and replenished at the scene of the illness or injury by the ambulance provider that transports the patient to the hospital or other receiving facility will be deemed to have been used by the ambulance provider. (2) To qualify under paragraph (v) of this section, the ambulance replenishing arrangement must satisfy all of the following four conditions— (i)(A) Under no circumstances may the ambulance provider (or first responder) and the receiving facility both bill for the same replenished drug or supply. Replenished drugs or supplies may only be billed (including claiming bad debt) to a Federal health care program by either the ambulance provider (or first responder) or the receiving facility. (B) All billing or claims submission by the receiving facility, ambulance provider or first responder for replenished drugs and medical supplies used in connection with the transport of a Federal health care program beneficiary must comply with all applicable Federal health care program payment and coverage rules and regulations. (C) Compliance with paragraph (v)(2)(i)(B) of this section will be determined separately for the receiving facility and the ambulance provider (and first responder, if any), so long as the receiving facility, ambulance provider (or first responder) refrains from doing anything that would impede the other party or parties from meeting their obligations under paragraph (v)(2)(i)(B). (ii)(A) The receiving facility or ambulance provider, or both, must ( 1 ) Maintain records of the replenished drugs and medical supplies and the patient transport to which the replenished drugs and medical supplies related; ( 2 ) Provide a copy of such records to the other party within a reasonable time (unless the other party is separately maintaining records of the replenished drugs and medical supplies); and ( 3 ) Make those records available to the Secretary promptly upon request. (B) A pre-hospital care report (including, but not limited to, a trip sheet, patient care report or patient encounter report) prepared by the ambulance provider and filed with the receiving facility will meet the requirements of paragraph (v)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, provided that it documents the specific type and amount of medical supplies and drugs used on the patient and subsequently replenished. (C) For purposes of paragraph (v)(2)(ii) of this section, documentation may be maintained and, if required, filed with the other party in hard copy or electronically. If a replenishing arrangement includes linens, documentation need not be maintained for their exchange. If documentation is not maintained for the exchange of linens, the receiving facility will be presumed to have provided an exchange of comparable clean linens for soiled linens for each ambulance transport of a patient to the receiving facility. Records required under paragraph (v)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be maintained for 5 years. (iii) The replenishing arrangement must not take into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part under any Federal health care program (other than the referral of the particular patient to whom the replenished drugs and medical supplies were furnished). (iv) The receiving facility and the ambulance provider otherwise comply with all Federal, State, and local laws regulating ambulance services, including, but not limited to, emergency services, and the provision of drugs and medical supplies, including, but not limited to, laws relating to the handling of controlled substances. (3) To qualify under paragraph (v) of this section, the arrangement must satisfy all of the standards in one of the following three categories: (i) General replenishing. (A) The receiving facility must replenish medical supplies or drugs on an equal basis for all ambulance providers that bring patients to the receiving facility in any one of the categories described in paragraph (v)(3)(i)(A)( 1 ), ( 2 ), or ( 3 ) of this section. A receiving facility may offer replenishing to one or more of the categories and may offer different replenishing arrangements to different categories, so long as the replenishing is conducted uniformly within each category. For example, a receiving facility may offer to replenish a broader array of drugs or supplies for ambulance providers that do no not charge for their services than for ambulance providers that charge for their services. Within each category, the receiving facility may limit its replenishing arrangements to the replenishing of emergency ambulance transports only. A receiving facility may offer replenishing to one or more of the categories— ( 1 ) All ambulance providers that do not bill any patient or insurer (including Federal health care programs) for ambulance services, regardless of the payor or the patient's ability to pay (i.e., ambulance providers, such as volunteer companies, that provide ambulance services without charge to any person or entity); ( 2 ) All not-for-profit and State or local government ambulance service providers (including, but not limited to, municipal and volunteer ambulance services providers); or ( 3 ) All ambulance service providers. (B)( 1 ) The replenishing arrangement must be conducted in an open and public manner. A replenishing arrangement will be considered to be conducted in an open and public manner if one of the following two conditions are satisfied: ( i ) A written disclosure of the replenishing program is posted conspicuously in the receiving facility's emergency room or other location where the ambulance providers deliver patients and copies are made available upon request to ambulance providers, Government representatives, and members of the public (subject to reasonable photocopying charges). The written disclosure can take any reasonable form and should include the category of ambulance service providers that qualifies for replenishment; the drugs or medical supplies included in the replenishment program; and the procedures for documenting the replenishment. A sample disclosure form is included in appendix A to subpart C of this part for illustrative purposes only. No written contracts between the parties are required for purposes of paragraph (v)(3)(i)(B)( 1 )( i ) of this section; or ( ii ) The replenishment arrangement operates in accordance with a plan or protocol of general application promulgated by an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Council or comparable entity, agency or organization, provided a copy of the plan or protocol is available upon request to ambulance providers, Government representatives and members of the public (subject to reasonable photocopying charges). While parties are encouraged to participate in collaborative, comprehensive, community-wide EMS systems to improve the delivery of EMS in their local communities, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the involvement of such organizations or the development or implementation of ambulance replenishment plans or protocols by such organizations. ( 2 ) Nothing in this paragraph (v)(3)(i) shall be construed as requiring disclosure of confidential proprietary or financial information related to the replenishing arrangement (including, but not limited to, information about cost, pricing or the volume of replenished drugs or supplies) to ambulance providers or members of the general public. (ii) Fair market value replenishing. (A) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (v)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the ambulance provider must pay the receiving facility fair market value, based on an arms-length transaction, for replenished medical supplies; and (B) If payment is not made at the same time as the replenishing of the medical supplies, the receiving facility and the ambulance provider must make commercially reasonable payment arrangements in advance. (iii) Government mandated replenishing. The replenishing arrangement is undertaken in accordance with a State or local statute, ordinance, regulation or binding protocol that requires hospitals or receiving facilities in the area subject to such requirement to replenish ambulances that deliver patients to the hospital with drugs or medical supplies (including linens) that are used during the transport of that patient. (4) For purposes of paragraph (v) of this section— (i) A receiving facility is a hospital or other facility that provides emergency medical services. (ii) An ambulance provider is a provider or supplier of ambulance transport services that provides emergency ambulance services. The term does not include a provider of ambulance transport services that provides only non-emergency transport services. (iii) A first responder includes, but is not limited to, a fire department, paramedic service or search and rescue squad that responds to an emergency call (through 9-1-1 or other emergency access number) and treats the patient, but does not transport the patient to the hospital or other receiving facility. (iv) An emergency ambulance service is a transport by ambulance initiated as a result of a call through 9-1-1 or other emergency access number or a call from another acute care facility unable to provide the higher level care required by the patient and available at the receiving facility. (v) Medical supplies includes linens, unless otherwise provided. (w) Health centers. As used in section 1128B of the Act, “remuneration” does not include the transfer of any goods, items, services, donations or loans (whether the donation or loan is in cash or in-kind), or combination thereof from an individual or entity to a health center (as defined in this paragraph), as long as the following nine standards are met— (1)(i) The transfer is made pursuant to a contract, lease, grant, loan, or other agreement that— (A) Is set out in writing; (B) Is signed by the parties; and (C) Covers, and specifies the amount of, all goods, items, services, donations, or loans to be provided by the individual or entity to the health center. (ii) The amount of goods, items, services, donations, or loans specified in the agreement in accordance with paragraph (w)(1)(i)(C) of this section may be a fixed sum, fixed percentage, or set forth by a fixed methodology. The amount may not be conditioned on the volume or value of Federal health care program business generated between the parties. The written agreement will be deemed to cover all goods, items, services, donations, or loans provided by the individual or entity to the health center as required by paragraph (w)(1)(i)(C) of this section if all separate agreements between the individual or entity and the health center incorporate each other by reference or if they cross-reference a master list of agreements that is maintained centrally, is kept up to date, and is available for review by the Secretary upon request. The master list should be maintained in a manner that preserves the historical record of arrangements. (2) The goods, items, services, donations, or loans are medical or clinical in nature or relate directly to services provided by the health center as part of the scope of the health center's section 330 grant (including, by way of example, billing services, administrative support services, technology support, and enabling services, such as case management, transportation, and translation services, that are within the scope of the grant). (3) The health center reasonably expects the arrangement to contribute meaningfully to the health center's ability to maintain or increase the availability, or enhance the quality, of services provided to a medically underserved population served by the health center, and the health center documents the basis for the reasonable expectation prior to entering the arrangement. The documentation must be made available to the Secretary upon request. (4) At reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the health center must re-evaluate the arrangement to ensure that the arrangement is expected to continue to satisfy the standard set forth in paragraph (w)(3) of this section, and must document the re-evaluation contemporaneously. The documentation must be made available to the Secretary upon request. Arrangements must not be renewed or renegotiated unless the health center reasonably expects the standard set forth in paragraph (w)(3) of this section to be satisfied in the next agreement term. Renewed or renegotiated agreements must comply with the requirements of paragraph (w)(3) of this section. (5) The individual or entity does not (i) Require the health center (or its affiliated health care professionals) to refer patients to a particular individual or entity, or (ii) restrict the health center (or its affiliated health care professionals) from referring patients to any individual or entity. (6) Individuals and entities that offer to furnish goods, items, or services without charge or at a reduced charge to the health center must furnish such goods, items, or services to all patients from the health center who clinically qualify for the goods, items, or services, regardless of the patient's payor status or ability to pay. The individual or entity may impose reasonable limits on the aggregate volume or value of the goods, items, or services furnished under the arrangement with the health center, provided such limits do not take into account a patient's payor status or ability to pay. (7) The agreement must not restrict the health center's ability, if it chooses, to enter into agreements with other providers or suppliers of comparable goods, items, or services, or with other lenders or donors. Where a health center has multiple individuals or entities willing to offer comparable remuneration, the health center must employ a reasonable methodology to determine which individuals or entities to select and must document its determination. In making these determinations, health centers should look to the procurement standards for beneficiaries of Federal grants set forth in 45 CFR 75.326 through 75.340. (8) The health center must provide effective notification to patients of their freedom to choose any willing provider or supplier. In addition, the health center must disclose the existence and nature of an agreement under paragraph (w)(1) of this section to any patient who inquires. The health center must provide such notification or disclosure in a timely fashion and in a manner reasonably calculated to be effective and understood by the patient. (9) The health center may, at its option, elect to require that an individual or entity charge a referred health center patient the same rate it charges other similarly situated patients not referred by the health center or that the individual or entity charge a referred health center patient a reduced rate (where the discount applies to the total charge and not just to the cost-sharing portion owed by an insured patient). For purposes of this paragraph, the term “health center” means a Federally Qualified Health Center under section 1905(l)(2)(B)(i) or 1905(l)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, and “medically underserved population” means a medically underserved population as defined in regulations at 42 CFR 51c.102(e). (x) Electronic prescribing items and services. As used in section 1128B of the Act, “remuneration” does not include nonmonetary remuneration (consisting of items and services in the form of hardware, software, or information technology and training services) necessary and used solely to receive and transmit electronic prescription information, if all of the following conditions are met: (1) The items and services are provided by a— (i) Hospital to a physician who is a member of its medical staff; (ii) Group practice to a prescribing health care professional who is a member of the group practice; and (iii) A PDP sponsor or MA organization to pharmacists and pharmacies participating in the network of such sponsor or organization and to prescribing health care professionals. (2) The items and services are provided as part of, or are used to access, an electronic prescription drug program that meets the applicable standards under Medicare Part D at the time the items and services are provided. (3) The donor (or any person on the donor's behalf) does not take any action to limit or restrict the use or compatibility of the items or services with other electronic prescribing or electronic health records systems. (4) For items or services that are of the type that can be used for any patient without regard to payor status, the donor does not restrict, or take any action to limit, the recipient's right or ability to use the items or services for any patient. (5) Neither the recipient nor the recipient's practice (or any affiliated individual or entity) makes the receipt of items or services, or the amount or nature of the items or services, a condition of doing business with the donor. (6) Neither the eligibility of a beneficiary for the items or services, nor the amount or nature of the items or services, is determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated between the parties. (7) The arrangement is set forth in a written agreement that— (i) Is signed by the parties; (ii) Specifies the items and services being provided and the donor's cost of the items and services; and (iii) Covers all of the electronic prescribing items and services to be provided by the donor (or affiliated parties). This requirement will be met if all separate agreements between the donor (and affiliated parties) and the beneficiary incorporate each other by reference or if they cross-reference a master list of agreements that is maintained and updated centrally and is available for review by the Secretary upon request. The master list should be maintained in a manner that preserves the historical record of agreements. (8) The donor does not have actual knowledge of, and does not act in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of, the fact that the beneficiary possesses or has obtained items or services equivalent to those provided by the donor. For purposes of paragraph (x) of this section, group practice shall have the meaning set forth at 42 CFR 411.352; member of the group practice shall mean all persons covered by the definition of “member of the group or member of a group practice” at 42 CFR 411.351, as well as other prescribing health care professionals who are owners or employees of the group practice; prescribing health care professional shall mean a physician or other health care professional licensed to prescribe drugs in the State in which the drugs are dispensed; PDP sponsor or MA organization shall have the meanings set forth at 42 CFR 423.4 and 422.2, respectively; prescription information shall mean information about prescriptions for drugs or for any other item or service normally accomplished through a written prescription; and electronic health record shall mean a repository of consumer health status information in computer processable form used for clinical diagnosis and treatment for a broad array of clinical conditions. (y) Electronic health records items and services. As used in section 1128B of the Act, “remuneration” does not include nonmonetary remuneration (consisting of items and services in the form of software or information technology and training services, including cybersecurity software and services) necessary and used predominantly to create, maintain, transmit, receive, or protect electronic health records, if all of the conditions in paragraphs (y)(1) through (13) of this section are met: (1) The items and services are provided to an individual or entity engaged in the delivery of health care by: (i) An individual or entity, other than a laboratory company, that: (A) Provides services covered by a Federal health care program and submits claims or requests for payment, either directly or through reassignment, to the Federal health care program; or (B) Is comprised of the types of individuals or entities in paragraph (y)(1)(i)(A) of this section; or (ii) A health plan. (2) The software is interoperable at the time it is provided to the recipient. For purposes of this paragraph (y)(2) of this section, software is deemed to be interoperable if, on the date it is provided to the recipient, it is certified by a certifying body authorized by the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to certification criteria identified in the then-applicable version of 45 CFR part 170. (3) [Reserved] (4) Neither the recipient nor the recipient's practice (or any affiliated individual or entity) makes the receipt of items or services, or the amount or nature of the items or services, a condition of doing business with the donor. (5) Neither the eligibility of a recipient for the items or services, nor the amount or nature of the items or services, is determined in a manner that directly takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated between the parties.

As used in section 1128B of the Act, “remuneration” does not include a patient engagement tool or support furnished by a VBE participant to a patient in the target patient population of a value-based arrangement to which the VBE participant is a party if all of the conditions in paragraphs (hh)(1) through (9) of this section are met: (1) The VBE participant is not: (i) A pharmaceutical manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler; (ii) A pharmacy benefit manager; (iii) A laboratory company; (iv) A pharmacy that primarily compounds drugs or primarily dispenses compounded drugs; (v) A manufacturer of a device or medical supply, unless the patient engagement tool or support is digital health technology; (vi) An entity or individual that sells or rents durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, or supplies covered by a Federal health care program (other than a pharmacy, a manufacturer of a device or medical supply, or a physician, provider, or other entity that primarily furnishes services); (vii) A medical device distributor or wholesaler that is not otherwise a manufacturer of a device or medical supply; or (viii) A manufacturer of a device or medical supply that was obligated under 42 CFR 403.906 to report one or more ownership or investment interests held by a physician or an immediate family member during the preceding calendar year, or that reasonably anticipates that it will be obligated to report one or more ownership or investment interests held by a physician or an immediate family member during the present calendar year, even if the patient engagement tool or support is digital health technology (for purposes of this paragraph, the terms “ownership or investment interest,” “physician,” and “immediate family member” have the same meaning as set forth in 42 CFR 403.902). (2) The patient engagement tool or support is furnished directly to the patient (or the patient's caregiver, family member, or other individual acting on the patient's behalf) by a VBE participant that is a party to the value-based arrangement or its eligible agent. (3) The patient engagement tool or support: (i) Is an in-kind item, good, or service; (ii) That has a direct connection to the coordination and management of care of the target patient population; (iii) Does not include any cash or cash equivalent; (iv) Does not result in medically unnecessary or inappropriate items or services reimbursed in whole or in part by a Federal health care program; (v) Is recommended by the patient's licensed health care professional; and (vi) Advances one or more of the following goals: (A) Adherence to a treatment regimen determined by the patient's licensed health care professional.

(5) The aggregate retail value of patient engagement tools and supports furnished to a patient by a VBE participant on an annual basis does not exceed $500. The monetary cap set forth in this paragraph (hh)(5) is adjusted each calendar year to the nearest whole dollar by the increase in the Consumer Price Index—Urban All Items (CPI-U) for the 12-month period ending the preceding September 30. OIG will publish guidance after September 30 of each year reflecting the increase in the CPI-U for the 12-month period ending September 30 and the new monetary cap applicable for the following calendar year. (6) The VBE participant or any eligible agent does not exchange or use the patient engagement tools or supports to market other reimbursable items or services or for patient recruitment purposes. (7) For a period of at least 6 years, the VBE participant makes available to the Secretary, upon request, all materials and records sufficient to establish that the patient engagement tool or support was distributed in a manner that meets the conditions of this paragraph (hh).

(4) For purposes of remuneration that satisfies this paragraph (ii), the safe harbor protects: (i) For a CMS-sponsored model governed by participation documentation other than the legal instrument setting forth the terms and conditions of a grant or a cooperative agreement, the exchange of remuneration between CMS-sponsored model parties that occurs on or after the first day on which services under the CMS-sponsored model begin and no later than 6 months after the final payment determination made by CMS under the model; (ii) For a CMS-sponsored model governed by the legal instrument setting forth the terms and conditions of a grant or cooperative agreement, the exchange of remuneration between CMS-sponsored model parties that occurs on or after the first day of the period of performance (as defined at 45 CFR 75.2) or such other date specified in the participation documentation and no later than 6 months after closeout occurs pursuant to 45 CFR 75.381; and (iii) For a CMS-sponsored model patient incentive, an incentive given on or after the first day on which patient care services may be furnished under the CMS-sponsored model as specified by CMS in the participation documentation and no later than the last day on which patient care services may be furnished under the CMS-sponsored model, unless a different timeframe is established in the participation documentation. A patient may retain any incentives furnished in compliance with paragraph (ii)(2) of this section. (jj) Cybersecurity technology and related services. As used in section 1128B of the Act, “remuneration” does not include nonmonetary remuneration (consisting of cybersecurity technology and services) that is necessary and used predominantly to implement, maintain, or reestablish effective cybersecurity if all of the conditions in paragraphs (jj)(1) through (4) of this section are met.

(3) A general description of the technology and services being provided and the amount of the recipient's contribution, if any, are set forth in writing and signed by the parties. (4) The donor does not shift the costs of the technology or services to any Federal health care program.

(2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the term— Failure to grant immediate access means the failure to grant access at the time of a reasonable request or to provide a compelling reason why access may not be granted. Reasonable request means a written request made by a properly identified agent of the Secretary, of a State survey agency or of another authorized entity, during hours that the facility, agency or institution is open for business.

(2) Before imposing an exclusion in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the OIG must determine that the administrator of the health education loan, scholarship, or loan repayment program has taken all reasonable administrative steps to secure repayment of the loans or obligations. When an individual has been offered a Medicare offset arrangement as required by section 1892 of the Act, the OIG will find that all reasonable steps have been taken. (3) The OIG will take into account access of beneficiaries to physicians' services for which payment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs in determining whether to impose an exclusion. (4) The OIG will not exclude a physician who is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community if a State requests that the physician not be excluded. (b) Length of exclusion.

(c) Length of exclusion. (1) If the entity has been excluded, the length of the individual's exclusion will be for the same period as that of the sanctioned entity. (2) If the entity was not excluded, the length of the individual's exclusion will be determined by considering the factors that would have been considered if the entity had been excluded.

Exclusions of individuals and entities under this title will be from Medicare, Medicaid and any of the other Federal health care programs, as defined in § 1001.2. (b) Effect of exclusion on excluded individuals and entities. (1) Unless and until an individual or entity is reinstated into the Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs in accordance with subpart F of this part, no payment will be made by Medicare, including Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans, Medicaid, or any other Federal health care program for any item or service furnished, on or after the effective date specified in the notice— (i) By an excluded individual or entity; or (ii) At the medical direction or on the prescription of a physician or an authorized individual who is excluded when the person furnishing such item or service knew, or had reason to know, of the exclusion. (2) This section applies regardless of whether an individual or entity has obtained a program provider number or equivalent, either as an individual or as a member of a group, prior to being reinstated. (3) An excluded individual or entity may not take assignment of an enrollee's claim on or after the effective date of exclusion. (4) An excluded individual or entity that submits, or causes to be submitted, claims for items or services furnished during the exclusion period is subject to civil money penalty liability under section 1128A(a)(1)(D) of the Act and criminal liability under section 1128B(a)(3) of the Act and other provisions. In addition, submitting claims, or causing claims to be submitted or payments to be made, for items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed, including administrative and management services or salary, may serve as the basis for denying reinstatement to the programs. (c) Exceptions to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1) If an enrollee of Part B of Medicare submits an otherwise payable claim for items or services furnished by an excluded individual or entity, or under the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded physician or other authorized individual after the effective date of exclusion, CMS will pay the first claim submitted by the enrollee and immediately notify the enrollee of the exclusion. (2) CMS will not pay an enrollee for items or services furnished by an excluded individual or entity, or under the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded physician or other authorized individual more than 15 days after the date on the notice to the enrollee, or after the effective date of the exclusion, whichever is later. (3) Unless the Secretary determines that the health and safety of beneficiaries receiving services under Medicare, Medicaid or any of the other Federal health care programs warrants the exclusion taking effect earlier, payment may be made under such program for up to 30 days after the effective date of the exclusion for— (i) Inpatient institutional services furnished to an individual who was admitted to an excluded institution before the date of the exclusion, (ii) Home health services and hospice care furnished to an individual under a plan of care established before the effective date of the exclusion, and (iii) Any health care items that are ordered by a practitioner, provider or supplier from an excluded manufacturer before the effective date of the exclusion and delivered within 30 days of the effective date of such exclusion. (For the period October 2, 1998, to October 4, 1999, payment may be made under Medicare or a State health care program for up to 60 days after the effective date of the exclusion for any health care items that are ordered by a practitioner, provider or supplier from an excluded manufacturer before the effective date of such exclusion and delivered within 60 days of the effect of the exclusion.) (4) CMS will not pay any claims submitted by, or for items or services ordered or prescribed by, an excluded provider for dates of service 15 days or more after the notice of the provider's exclusion was mailed to the supplier. (5)(i) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, payment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs for certain emergency items or services furnished by an excluded individual or entity, or at the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded physician or other authorized individual during the period of exclusion. To be payable, a claim for such emergency items or services must be accompanied by a sworn statement of the person furnishing the items or services specifying the nature of the emergency and why the items or services could not have been furnished by an individual or entity eligible to furnish or order such items or services. (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, no claim for emergency items or services will be payable if such items or services were provided by an excluded individual who, through an employment, contractual or any other arrangement, routinely provides emergency health care items or services.",

(1) Under authority of section 1902(a)(4) of the Act, this part sets forth methods of administration and procedures the State agency must follow to exclude a provider from participation in the State Medicaid program. State-initiated exclusion from Medicaid may lead to OIG exclusion from all Federal health care programs. (2) Under authority of sections 1124 and 1126 of the Act, this part requires the Medicaid agency to obtain and disclose to the OIG certain provider ownership and control information, along with actions taken on a provider's application to participate in the program. (3) Under authority of sections 1902(a)(41) and 1128 of the Act, this part requires the State agency to notify the OIG of sanctions and other actions the State takes to limit a provider's participation in Medicaid. (4) Section 1902(p) of the Act permits the State to exclude an individual or entity from Medicaid for any reason the Secretary can exclude and requires the State to exclude certain managed care entities that could be excluded by the OIG. (5) Sections 1902(a)(39) and 1903(i)(2) of the Act prohibit State payments to providers and deny Federal financial participation (FFP) in State expenditures for items or services furnished by an individual or entity that has been excluded by the OIG from participation in Federal health care programs. (b) Scope. This part specifies certain bases upon which the State may or, in some cases, must exclude an individual or entity from participation in the Medicaid program and the administrative procedures the State must follow to do so. These regulations specifically address the authority of State agencies to exclude on their own initiative, regardless of whether the OIG has excluded an individual or entity under part 1001 of this chapter. In addition, this part delineates the States' obligation to obtain certain information from Medicaid providers and to inform the OIG of information received and actions taken.",

    "heading": "",
    "content": "§ 1003.140   Determinations regarding the amount of penalties and assessments and the period of exclusion. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, in determining the amount of any penalty or assessment or the period of exclusion in accordance with this part, the OIG will consider the following factors— (1) The nature and circumstances of the violation; (2) The degree of culpability of the person against whom a civil money penalty, assessment, or exclusion is proposed. It should be considered an aggravating circumstance if the respondent had actual knowledge where a lower level of knowledge was required to establish liability ( e.g., for a provision that establishes liability if the respondent “knew or should have known” a claim was false or fraudulent, it will be an aggravating circumstance if the respondent knew the claim was false or fraudulent). It should be a mitigating circumstance if the person took appropriate and timely corrective action in response to the violation. For purposes of this part, corrective action must include disclosing the violation to the OIG through the Self-Disclosure Protocol and fully cooperating with the OIG's review and resolution of such disclosure, or in cases of physician self-referral law violations, disclosing the violation to CMS through the Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol; (3) The history of prior offenses. Aggravating circumstances include, if at any time prior to the violation, the individual—or in the case of an entity, the entity itself; any individual who had a direct or indirect ownership or control interest (as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act) in a sanctioned entity at the time the violation occurred and who knew, or should have known, of the violation; or any individual who was an officer or a managing employee (as defined in section 1126(b) of the Act) of such an entity at the time the violation occurred—was held liable for criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions in connection with a program covered by this part or in connection with the delivery of a health care item or service; (4) Other wrongful conduct. Aggravating circumstances include proof that the individual—or in the case of an entity, the entity itself; any individual who had a direct or indirect ownership or control interest (as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act) in a sanctioned entity at the time the violation occurred and who knew, or should have known, of the violation; or any individual who was an officer or a managing employee (as defined in section 1126(b) of the Act) of such an entity at the time the violation occurred—engaged in wrongful conduct, other than the specific conduct upon which liability is based, relating to a government program or in connection with the delivery of a health care item or service. The statute of limitations governing civil money penalty proceedings does not apply to proof of other wrongful conduct as an aggravating circumstance; and (5) Such other matters as justice may require. Other circumstances of an aggravating or mitigating nature should be considered if, in the interests of justice, they require either a reduction or an increase in the penalty, assessment, or period of exclusion to achieve the purposes of this part. (b)(1) After determining the amount of any penalty and assessment in accordance with this part, the OIG considers the ability of the person to pay the proposed civil money penalty or assessment. The person shall provide, in a time and manner requested by the OIG, sufficient financial documentation, including, but not limited to, audited financial statements, tax returns, and financial disclosure statements, deemed necessary by the OIG to determine the person's ability to pay the penalty or assessment. (2) If the person requests a hearing in accordance with 42 CFR 1005.2, the only financial documentation subject to review is that which the person provided to the OIG during the administrative process, unless the ALJ finds that extraordinary circumstances prevented the person from providing the financial documentation to the OIG in the time and manner requested by the OIG prior to the hearing request. (c) In determining the amount of any penalty and assessment to be imposed under this part the following circumstances are also to be considered— (1) If there are substantial or several mitigating circumstances, the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should be set at an amount sufficiently below the maximum permitted by this part to reflect that fact. (2) If there are substantial or several aggravating circumstances, the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should be set at an amount sufficiently close to or at the maximum permitted by this part to reflect that fact. (3) Unless there are extraordinary mitigating circumstances, the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should not be less than double the approximate amount of damages and costs (as defined by paragraph (d)(2) of this section) sustained by the United States, or any State, as a result of the violation. (4) The presence of any single aggravating circumstance may justify imposing a penalty and assessment at or close to the maximum even when one or more mitigating factors is present. (d)(1) The standards set forth in this section are binding, except to the extent that their application would result in imposition of an amount that would exceed limits imposed by the United States Constitution. (2) The amount imposed will not be less than the approximate amount required to fully compensate the United States, or any State, for its damages and costs, tangible and intangible, including, but not limited to, the costs attributable to the investigation, prosecution, and administrative review of the case. (3) Nothing in this part limits the authority of the Department or the OIG to settle any issue or case as provided by § 1003.1530 or to compromise any exclusion and any penalty and assessment as provided by § 1003.1550. (4) Penalties, assessments, and exclusions imposed under this part are in addition to any other penalties, assessments, or other sanctions prescribed by law. (5) The penalty amounts in this part are updated annually, as adjusted in accordance with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (section 701 of Pub. L. 114-74). Annually adjusted amounts are published at 45 CFR part 102.",

(b) The sanction is effective 20 days from the date of the notice. Receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. (c) The notice must specify— (1) The legal and factual basis for the determination; (2) The sanction to be imposed; (3) The effective date and, if appropriate, the duration of the exclusion; (4) The appeal rights of the practitioner or other person; (5) The opportunity and the process necessary to provide alternative notification as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section; and (6) In the case of exclusion, the earliest date on which the OIG will accept a request for reinstatement. (d) Patient notification. (1)(i) The OIG will provide a sanctioned practitioner or other person an opportunity to elect to inform each of their patients of the sanction action. In order to elect this option, the sanctioned practitioner or other person must, within 30 calendar days from receipt of the OIG notice, inform both new and existing patients through written notice—based on a suggested (non-mandatory) model provided to the sanctioned individual by the OIG—of the sanction and, in the case of an exclusion, its effective date. Receipt of the OIG notice is presumed to be 5 days after the date of the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. Within this same period, the practitioner or other person must also sign and return the certification that the OIG will provide with the notice. For purposes of this section, the term “all existing patients” includes all patients currently under active treatment with the practitioner or other person, as well as all patients who have been treated by the practitioner or other person within the last 3 years. In addition, the practitioner or other person must notify all prospective patients orally at the time such persons request an appointment. If the sanctioned party is a hospital, it must notify all physicians who have privileges at the hospital, and must post a notice in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities regarding the exclusion. In addition, for purposes of this section, the term “in all affiliated entities” encompasses all entities and properties in which the hospital has a direct or indirect ownership interest of 5 percent or more and any management, partnership or control of the entity. (ii) The certification will provide that the practitioner or other person— (A) Has informed each of his, her or its patients in writing that the practitioner or other person has been sanctioned, or if a hospital, has informed all physicians having privileges at the hospital that it has been sanctioned; (B) If excluded from Medicare and the State health care programs, has informed his, her or its existing patients in writing that the programs will not pay for items and services furnished or ordered (or at the medical direction or on the prescription of an excluded physician) by the practitioner or other person until they are reinstated, or if a hospital, has provided this information to all physicians having privileges at that hospital; (C) If excluded from Medicare and State health care programs, will provide prospective patients—or if a hospital, physicians requesting privileges at that hospital prior to furnishing or ordering (or in the case of an excluded physician, medically directing or prescribing) services—oral information of both the sanction and that the programs will not pay for services provided and written notification of the same at the time of the provision of services; (D) If excluded from Medicare and State health care programs and is an entity such as a hospital, has posted a notice in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities that the programs will not pay for services provided; and (E) Certifies to the truthfulness and accuracy of the notification and the statements in the certification. (2) If the sanctioned practitioner or other person does not inform his, her or its patients and does not return the required certification within the 30-day period, or if the sanctioned practitioner or other person returns the certification within the 30-day period but the OIG obtains reliable evidence that such person nevertheless has not adequately informed new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG— (i) Will see that the public is notified directly of the identity of the sanctioned practitioner or other person, the finding that the obligation has been violated, and the effective date of any exclusion; and (ii) May consider this failure to adhere to the certification obligation as an adverse factor at the time the sanctioned practitioner or other person requests reinstatement. (3) If the sanctioned practitioner or other person is entitled to a preliminary hearing in accordance with § 1004.140(a) and requests such a preliminary hearing, and if the administrative law judge (ALJ) decides that he, she or it poses a risk to program beneficiaries, the sanctioned practitioner or other person would have 30 days from the date of receipt of the ALJ's decision to provide certification to the OIG in accordance with § 1004.110(d)(1). The date of receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the date of the ALJ's decision, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. (e) Notice of the sanction is also provided to the following entities as appropriate— (1) The QIO that originated the sanction report; (2) QIOs in adjacent areas; (3) State Medicaid fraud control units and State licensing and accreditation bodies; (4) Appropriate program contractors and State agencies; (5) Hospitals, including the hospital where the sanctioned individual's case originated and where the individual currently has privileges, if known; skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and health maintenance organizations and Federally-funded community health centers where the practitioner or other person works; (6) Medical societies and other professional organizations; and (7) Medicare carriers and fiscal intermediaries, health care prepayment plans and other affected agencies and organizations. (f) If an exclusion sanction is effectuated because a decision was not made within 120 days after receipt of the QIO recommendation, notification is as follows— (1) As soon as possible after the 120th day, the OIG will issue a notice to the practitioner or other person, in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, affirming the QIO recommendation based on the OIG's review of the case, and that the exclusion is effective 20 days from the date of the notice; and (2) Notice of sanction is also provided as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.",

(1)(i) A practitioner or other person excluded from participation in Medicare and any State health care programs under section 1156 of the Act may request a preliminary hearing if the location where services are rendered to over 50 percent of the practitioner's or other person's patients at the time of the exclusion notice is in a rural HPSA or in a county with a population of less than 70,000. (ii) Unless the practitioner's or other person's practice meets the definition for psychiatric professional, vision care professional, dental professional, podiatric professional or pharmacy professional, the HPSA used by the OIG for determination of entitlement to a preliminary hearing will be the HPSA list for primary medical care professional. (iii) Information on the population size of a county in order to determine entitlement to a preliminary hearing will be obtained by the OIG from the responsible officials of that county. (2)(i) A request for a preliminary hearing must be made in writing and received by the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) no later than the 15th day after the notice of exclusion is received by a practitioner or other person. The date of receipt of the notice of exclusion by the practitioner or other person is presumed to be 5 days after the date appearing on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. (ii) A request for a preliminary hearing will stay the effective date of the exclusion pending a decision of the ALJ at the preliminary hearing, and all the parties informed by the OIG of the exclusion will be notified of the stay. (iii) A request for a preliminary hearing received after the 15-day period has expired will be treated as a request for a hearing before an ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. (iv) If the practitioner or other person exercises his, her or its right to a preliminary hearing, such a hearing must be held by the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section unless the OIG waives it in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. (v) The ALJ cannot consolidate the preliminary hearing with a full hearing without the approval of all parties to the hearing. (3)(i) The preliminary hearing will be conducted by an ALJ of the DAB in a city that the ALJ deems equitable to all parties. The ALJ will conduct the preliminary hearing and render a decision no later than 45 days after receipt of the request for such a hearing by the DAB. Unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary, date of receipt by the DAB is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the request for a preliminary hearing or, if undated, the date of receipt will be the date the DAB actually received the request. A reasonable extension to the 45-day period of up to 15 days may be requested by any party to the preliminary hearing and such a request may be granted upon concurrence by all parties to the preliminary hearing. Such request must be received no later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date of the preliminary hearing. (ii) The only issue to be heard and decided on by the ALJ at the preliminary hearing, based on the preponderance of the evidence, is whether the practitioner's or other person's continued participation in the Medicare and State health care programs during the appeal of the exclusion before an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk. The ALJ's decision is to be based on the preponderance of the evidence. (iii) In the interest of time, the ALJ may issue an oral decision to be followed by a written decision. (iv) In those cases where the ALJ has stayed an exclusion after a preliminary hearing, a full hearing must be held and a decision rendered by the ALJ within 6 months. If, for any reason, the request for a full hearing before the ALJ is withdrawn or dismissed, the practitioner or other person will be excluded effective 5 days after the notice of the withdrawal or dismissal is received in the OIG headquarters. (4) The preliminary hearing decision is not appealable or subject to further administrative or judicial review. (5) A practitioner or other person found at the preliminary hearing not to place program beneficiaries at serious risk, but later determined to have been properly excluded from program participation after a full hearing before an ALJ, is not entitled to have the exclusion stayed further during an appeal to the DAB. Exclusions in such instances will be effective 5 days after receipt of the ALJ decision in the OIG headquarters. (6)(i) After notice of a timely request for a preliminary hearing, the OIG may determine that the practitioner's or other person's continued program participation during the appeal before the ALJ will not place program beneficiaries at serious risk and waive the preliminary hearing. Under these circumstances, the exclusion will be stayed pending the decision of the ALJ after a full hearing. the hearing must be held, and a decision reached, within 6 months. (ii) If the OIG decides to waive the preliminary hearing, the request for the preliminary hearing will be considered a request for a hearing before the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. (b) Right to administrative review. (1) A practitioner or other person dissatisfied with an OIG determination, or an exclusion that results from a determination not being made within 120 days, is entitled to appeal such sanction in accordance with part 1005 of this chapter. (2) Due to the 120-day statutory requirement specified in § 1004.100(e), the following limitations apply— (i) The period of time for submitting additional information will not be extended. (ii) Any material received by the OIG after the 30-day period allowed will not be considered by the ALJ or the DAB. (3) The OIG's determination continues in effect unless reversed by a hearing. (c) Rights to judicial review. Any practitioner or other person dissatisfied with a final decision of the Secretary may file a civil action in accordance with the provisions of section 205(g) of the Act.",

(c) Burden of proof in all other exclusion cases. In all exclusion cases except those governed by paragraph (b) of this section, the ALJ will allocate the burden of proof as the ALJ deems appropriate. (d) The burden of persuasion will be judged by a preponderance of the evidence. (e) The hearing will be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ for good cause shown. (f)(1) A hearing under this part is not limited to specific items and information set forth in the notice letter to the petitioner or respondent. Subject to the 15-day requirement under § 1005.8, additional items and information, including aggravating or mitigating circumstances that arose or became known subsequent to the issuance of the notice letter, may be introduced by either party during its case-in-chief unless such information or items are— (i) Privileged; (ii) Disqualified from consideration due to untimeliness in accordance with § 1004.130(a)(2)(ii); or (iii) Deemed otherwise inadmissible under § 1005.17. (2) After both parties have presented their cases, evidence may be admitted on rebuttal even if not previously exchanged in accordance with § 1005.8.",

(d) The ALJ will permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination of witnesses as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. (e) The ALJ may order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses.

(g) The DAB may decline to review the case, or may affirm, increase, reduce, reverse or remand any penalty, assessment or exclusion determined by the ALJ.

The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the initial decision is erroneous. (i) Within 60 days after the time for submission of briefs and reply briefs, if permitted, has expired, the DAB will issue to each party to the appeal a copy of the DAB's decision and a statement describing the right of any petitioner or respondent who is found liable to seek judicial review.

The petition copy will be time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original is filed with the court.

This part codifies sections 1903(a)(6) and 1903(b)(3) of the Social Security Act (the Act), which establish the amounts and conditions of Federal matching payments for expenditures incurred in establishing and operating a State MFCU. This part also implements section 1903(q) of the Act, which establishes the basic requirements and standards that Units must meet to demonstrate that they are effectively carrying out the functions of the Unit in order to be certified by OIG as eligible for FFP under Title XIX of the Act. Section 1902(a)(61) of the Act requires a State to provide in its Medicaid State plan that it operates a Unit that effectively carries out the functions and requirements described in this part, as determined in accordance with standards established by OIG, unless the State demonstrates that a Unit would not be cost effective because of minimal Medicaid fraud in the covered services under the plan and that beneficiaries under the plan will be protected from abuse and neglect in connection with the provision of medical assistance under the plan without the existence of such a Unit. CMS retains the authority to determine a State's compliance with Medicaid State plan requirements in accordance with section 1902(a) of the Act. (b) Organization of this part. Subpart A of this part defines terms used in this part and sets forth the statutory basis and organization of this part. Subpart B specifies the certification requirements that a Unit must meet to be eligible for FFP, including requirements for applying and reapplying for certification. Subpart C specifies FFP rates, costs eligible and not eligible for FFP, and FFP disallowance procedures. Subpart D specifies other HHS regulations applicable to the MFCU grants.",

(b) If there is no State agency with statewide authority and capability for criminal fraud or patient or resident abuse or neglect prosecutions, the Unit has established formal written procedures ensuring that the Unit refers suspected cases of criminal fraud in the State Medicaid program or of patient or resident abuse and neglect to the appropriate prosecuting authority or authorities, and coordinates with and assists such authority or authorities in the prosecution of such cases. (c) The Unit has a formal working relationship with the office of the State Attorney General, or another office with statewide prosecutorial authority, and has formal written procedures for referring to the State Attorney General or other office suspected criminal violations and for effective coordination of the activities of both entities relating to the detection, investigation, and prosecution of those violations relating to the State Medicaid program. Under this working relationship, the office of the State Attorney General, or other office, must agree to assume responsibility for prosecuting alleged criminal violations referred to it by the Unit.

(2) Fraud in any aspect of the provision of health care services and activities of providers of such services under any Federal health care program (as defined in section 1128B(f)(1)of the Act), if the Unit obtains the written approval of the Inspector General of the relevant agency and the suspected fraud or violation of law in such case or investigation is primarily related to the State Medicaid program. (b)(1) The Unit will also review complaints alleging abuse or neglect of patients or residents in health care facilities receiving payments under Medicaid and may review complaints of the misappropriation of funds or property of patients or residents of such facilities. (2) At the option of the Unit, it may review complaints of abuse or neglect, including misappropriation of funds or property, of patients or residents of board and care facilities, regardless of whether payment to such facilities is made under Medicaid. (3) If the initial review of the complaint indicates substantial potential for criminal prosecution, the Unit will investigate the complaint or refer it to an appropriate criminal investigative or prosecutorial authority. (4) If the initial review does not indicate a substantial potential for criminal prosecution, the Unit will, if appropriate, refer the complaint to the proper Federal, State, or local agency. (c) If the Unit, in carrying out its duties and responsibilities under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, discovers that overpayments have been made to a health care facility or other provider, the Unit will either recover such overpayment as part of its resolution of a fraud case or refer the matter to the appropriate State agency for collection. (d) Where a prosecuting authority other than the Unit is to assume responsibility for the prosecution of a case investigated by the Unit, the Unit will ensure that those responsible for the prosecutorial decision and the preparation of the case for trial have the fullest possible opportunity to participate in the investigation from its inception and will provide all necessary assistance to the prosecuting authority throughout all resulting prosecutions. (e)(1) The Unit, if requested, will make available to OIG investigators and attorneys, or to other Federal investigators and prosecutors, all information in the Unit's possession concerning investigations or prosecutions conducted by the Unit. (2) The Unit will coordinate with OIG investigators and attorneys, or with other Federal investigators and prosecutors, on any Unit cases involving the same suspects or allegations that are also under investigation or prosecution by OIG or other Federal investigators or prosecutors. (3) The Unit will establish a practice of regular Unit meetings or communication with OIG investigators and Federal prosecutors. (4) When the Unit lacks the authority or resources to pursue a case, including for allegations of Medicare fraud and for civil false claims actions in a State without a civil false claims act or other State authority, the Unit will make appropriate referrals to OIG investigators and attorneys or other Federal investigators or prosecutors. (5) The Unit will establish written policy consistent with paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section. (f) The Unit will guard the privacy rights of all beneficiaries and other individuals whose data is under the Unit's control and will provide adequate safeguards to protect sensitive information and data under the Unit's control. (g)(1) The Unit will transmit to OIG pertinent information on all convictions, including charging documents, plea agreements, and sentencing orders, for purposes of program exclusion under section 1128 of the Act. (2) Convictions include those obtained either by Unit prosecutors or non-Unit prosecutors in any case investigated by the Unit. (3) Such information will be transmitted to OIG within 30 days of sentencing, or as soon as practicable if the Unit encounters delays in receiving the necessary information from the court.",

(c) Basis for recertification. In reviewing the information described at § 1007.17(a) and (b), OIG will evaluate whether the Unit has demonstrated that it effectively carries out the functions and requirements described in section 1903(q) of the Act as implemented by this part. In making that determination, OIG will take into consideration the following factors: (1) Unit's compliance with this part and other Federal regulations, including those specified in § 1007.23; (2) Unit's compliance with OIG policy transmittals; (3) Unit's adherence to MFCU performance standards as published in the Federal Register ; (4) Unit's effectiveness in using its resources in investigating cases of possible fraud in the administration of the Medicaid program, the provision of medical assistance, or the activities of providers of medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan, and in prosecuting cases or cooperating with the prosecuting authorities; and (5) Unit's effectiveness in using its resources in reviewing and investigating, referring for investigation or prosecution, or criminally prosecuting complaints alleging abuse or neglect of patients or residents in health care facilities receiving payments under the State Medicaid plan and, at the Unit's option, in board and care facilities.

(1) Subject to the limitation of this section, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must reimburse each State by an amount equal to 90 percent of the allowable costs incurred by a certified Unit during the first 12 quarters of operation that are attributable to carrying out its functions and responsibilities under this part. Each quarter of operation must be counted in determining when the Unit has accumulated 12 quarters of operation and is, therefore, no longer eligible for a 90-percent matching rate. Quarters of operation do not have to be consecutive to accumulate. (2) Beginning with the 13th quarter of operation, the Secretary must reimburse 75 percent of allowable costs incurred by a certified Unit. (b) Retroactive certification. OIG may grant certification retroactive to the date on which the Unit first met all the requirements of section 1903(q) of the Act and of this part. For any quarter with respect to which the Unit is certified, the Secretary will provide reimbursement for the entire quarter. (c) Total amount of FFP. FFP for any quarter must not exceed the higher of $125,000 or one-quarter of 1 percent of the sums expended by the Federal, State, and local governments during the previous quarter in carrying out the State Medicaid program. (d) Costs eligible for FFP. (1) FFP is allowable under this part for the expenditures attributable to the establishment and operation of the Unit, including the cost of training personnel employed by the Unit and efforts to increase referrals to the Unit through program outreach. Reimbursement is allowable only for costs attributable to the specific responsibilities and functions set forth in this part and if the Unit has been certified and recertified by OIG. (2) Establishment costs are limited to clearly identifiable costs of personnel that meet the requirements of § 1007.13 of this part. (e) Costs not eligible for FFP. FFP is not allowable under this part for expenditures attributable to: (1) The investigation of cases involving program abuse or other failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, if these cases do not involve substantial allegations or other indications of fraud, as described in § 1007.11(a) of this part; (2) Routine verification with beneficiaries of whether services billed by providers were actually received, or, except as provided in § 1007.20, efforts to identify situations in which a question of fraud may exist by the screening of claims and analysis of patterns and practice that involve data mining as defined in § 1007.1. (3) The routine notification of providers that fraudulent claims may be punished under Federal or State law; (4) The performance of any audit or investigation, any professional legal function, or any criminal, civil or administrative prosecution of suspected providers by a person who does not meet the professional employee requirements in § 1007.13(d); (5) The investigation or prosecution of fraud cases involving a beneficiary's eligibility for benefits, unless the suspected fraud cases also involve conspiracy with a provider; (6) Any payment, direct or indirect, from the Unit to the Medicaid agency, other than payments for the salaries of employees on detail to the Unit; or (7) Temporary duties performed by professional employees that are not required functions and responsibilities of the Unit, as described at § 1007.13(d)(3).",

(5) The Unit may also seek reconsideration, and following the reconsideration decision, request a review from the Departmental Appeals Board. (6) If the Unit elects reconsideration, the reconsideration process must be completed or withdrawn before requesting review by the Departmental Appeals Board. (c) Procedures for reconsideration of a disallowance. (1) Within 60 days after receipt of the disallowance letter, the Unit shall, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, submit in writing to the Principal Deputy Inspector General any relevant evidence, documentation, or explanation. (2) After consideration of the policies and factual matters pertinent to the issues in question, the Principal Deputy Inspector General shall, within 60 days from the date of receipt of the request for reconsideration, issue a written decision or a request for additional information as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (3) At the Principal Deputy Inspector General's option, OIG may request from the Unit any additional information or documents necessary to make a decision. The request for additional information must be sent via registered or certified mail to establish the date the request was sent by OIG and received by the Unit. (4) Within 30 days after receipt of the request for additional information, the Unit must submit to the Principal Deputy Inspector General all requested documents and materials. (i) If the Principal Deputy Inspector General finds that the materials are not in readily reviewable form or that additional information is needed, he or she shall notify the Unit via registered or certified mail that it has 15 business days from the date of receipt of the notice to submit the readily reviewable or additional materials. (ii) If the Unit does not provide the necessary materials within 15 business days from the date of receipt of such notice, the Principal Deputy Inspector General shall affirm the disallowance in a final reconsideration decision issued within 15 days from the due date of additional information from the Unit. (5) If additional documentation is provided in readily reviewable form under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the Principal Deputy Inspector General shall issue a written decision within 60 days from the due date of such information. (6) The final written decision shall constitute final OIG administrative action on the reconsideration and shall be (within 15 business days of the decision) mailed to the Unit via registered or certified mail to establish the date the reconsideration decision was received by the Unit. (7) If the Principal Deputy Inspector General does not issue a decision within 60 days from the date of receipt of the request for reconsideration or the date of receipt of the requested additional information, the disallowance shall be deemed to be affirmed. (8) No section of this regulation shall be interpreted as waiving OIG's right to assert any provision or exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. (d) Withdrawal of a request for reconsideration of a disallowance. (1) A Unit may withdraw the request for reconsideration at any time before the notice of the reconsideration decision is received by the Unit without affecting its right to submit a notice of appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board.

(2) Within 60 days after OIG's receipt of a Unit's withdrawal request, a Unit may, in accordance with (f)(2) of this section, submit a notice of appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board. (e) Implementation of decisions for reconsideration of a disallowance. (1) After undertaking a reconsideration, the Principal Deputy Inspector General may affirm, reverse, or revise the disallowance and shall issue a final written reconsideration decision to the Unit in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this section. (2) If the reconsideration decision requires an adjustment of FFP, either upward or downward, a subsequent grant action will be made in the amount of such increase or decrease. (3) Within 60 days after receipt of a reconsideration decision from OIG, a Unit may, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, submit a notice of appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board. (f) Appeal of disallowance. (1) The Departmental Appeals Board reviews disallowances of FFP under Title XIX of the Act, including disallowances issued by OIG to the Units. (2) A Unit that wishes to appeal a disallowance to the Departmental Appeals Board must follow the requirements in 42 CFR 430.42(f)(2). (3) The appeals procedures are those set forth in 45 CFR part 16 for Medicaid and for many other programs, including the Units, administered by the Department. (4) The Departmental Appeals Board may affirm the disallowance, reverse the disallowance, modify the disallowance, or remand the disallowance to OIG for further consideration. (5) The Departmental Appeals Board will issue a final written decision to the Unit consistent with 45 CFR part 16. (6) If the appeal decision requires an adjustment of FFP, either upward or downward, a subsequent grant action will be made in the amount of such increase or decrease.",

The requestor is responsible for paying a fee equal to the costs incurred by the Department in responding to the request for an advisory opinion. (b) Payment Method. Payment for a request for an advisory opinion must be made to the Treasury of the United States, as directed by OIG. (c) Calculation of costs: Prior to the issuance of the advisory opinion, the OIG will calculate the costs incurred by the Department in responding to the request. The calculation will include the costs of salaries and benefits payable to attorneys and others who have worked on the request in question, as well as administrative and supervisory support for such person. The OIG has the exclusive authority to determine the cost of responding to a request for an advisory opinion and such determination is not reviewable or waiveable. (d) Agreement to pay all costs. (1) By submitting the request for an advisory opinion, the requestor agrees, except as indicated in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, to pay all costs incurred by the OIG in responding to the request for an advisory opinion. (2) In its request for an advisory opinion, the requestor may request a written estimate of the cost involved in processing the advisory opinion. Within 10 business days of receipt of the request, the OIG will notify in writing of such estimate. Such estimate will not be binding on the Department, and the actual cost to be paid may be higher or lower than estimated. The time period for issuing the advisory opinion will be tolled from the time the OIG notifies the requestor of the estimate until the OIG receives written confirmation from the requestor that the requestor wants the OIG to continue processing the request. Such notice may include a new or revised triggering dollar amount, as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. (3) In its request for an advisory opinion, the requestor may designate a triggering dollar amount. If the OIG estimates that the costs of processing the advisory opinion request have reached, or are likely to exceed, the designated triggering dollar amount, the OIG will notify the requestor. The requestor may revise its designated triggering dollar amount in writing in its response to notification of a cost estimate in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (4) If the OIG notifies the requestor that the estimated cost of processing the request has reached or is likely to exceed the triggering dollar amount, the OIG will stop processing the request until such time as the requestor makes a written request for the OIG to continue processing the request. Any delay in the processing of the request for an advisory opinion attributable to these procedures will toll the time for issuance of an advisory opinion until the requestor asks the OIG to continue working on the request. (5) If the requestor chooses not to pay for completion of an advisory opinion, or withdraws the request, the requestor is still obligated to pay for all costs incurred and identified by the OIG attributable to processing the request for an advisory opinion up to that point. (6) If the costs incurred by the OIG in responding to the request are greater than the amount paid by the requestor, the OIG will, prior to the issuance of the advisory opinion, notify the requestor of any additional amount due. The OIG will not issue an advisory opinion until the full amount owed by the requestor has been paid. Once the requestor has paid the OIG the total amount due for the costs of processing the request, the OIG will issue the advisory opinion. The time period for issuing advisory opinions will be tolled from the time the OIG notifies the requestor of the amount owed until the time full payment is received. (e) Fees for outside experts. (1) In addition to the fees identified in this section, the requestor also must pay any required fees for expert opinions, if any, from outside sources, as described in § 1008.33. (2) If the OIG determines that it is necessary to obtain expert advice to issue a requested advisory opinion, the OIG will notify the requestor of that fact and provide the identity of the appropriate expert and an estimate of the costs of the expert advice.",

(a) An advisory opinion will be considered issued once payment is received and it is dated, numbered, and signed by an authorized official of the OIG. (b) An advisory opinion will contain a description of the material facts provided to the OIG with regard to the arrangement for which an advisory opinion has been requested. The advisory opinion will state the OIG's opinion regarding the subject matter of the request based on the facts provided to the OIG. If necessary, to fully describe the arrangement, the OIG is authorized to include in the advisory opinion the material facts of the arrangement, notwithstanding that some of these facts could be considered confidential information or trade secrets within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1905. (c)(1) The OIG will issue an advisory opinion, in accordance with the provisions of this part, within 60 days after the request for an advisory opinion has been formally accepted; (2) If the 60th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period will end at the close of the next business day following the weekend or holiday; (3) The 60 day period will be tolled from the time the OIG— (i) Notifies the requestor that the costs have reached, or are likely to exceed, the triggering amount until the time when the OIG receives written notice from the requestor to continue processing the request; (ii) Requests additional information from the requestor until the time the OIG receives the requested information; (iii) Notifies the requestor of the full amount due until the time the OIG receives payment of the full amount owed; and (iv) Notifies the requestor of the need for expert advice until the time the OIG receives the expert advice. (d) After OIG has notified the requestor of the full amount owed and OIG has determined that the full payment of that amount has been properly paid by the requestor, OIG will issue the advisory opinion and promptly mail it to the requestor by regular first class U.S. mail.",

(a) Any advisory opinion given by the OIG is without prejudice to the right of the OIG to reconsider the questions involved and, where the public interest requires, to rescind, terminate or modify the advisory opinion. Requestors will be given a preliminary notice of the OIG's intent to rescind, terminate or modify the opinion, and will be provided a reasonable opportunity to respond. A final notice of rescission, termination or modification will be given to the requestor so that the individual or entity may discontinue or modify, as the case may be, the course of action taken in accordance with the OIG advisory opinion. (b) For purposes of this part— (1) To rescind an advisory opinion means that the advisory opinion is revoked retroactively to the original date of issuance with the result that the advisory opinion will be deemed to have been without force and effect from the original date of issuance. Recission may occur only where relevant and material facts were not fully, completely and accurately disclosed to the OIG. (2) To terminate an advisory opinion means that the advisory opinion is revoked as of the termination date and is no longer in force and effect after the termination date. The OIG will not proceed against the requestor under this part if such action was promptly, diligently, and in good faith discontinued in accordance with reasonable time frames established by the OIG after consultation with the requestor. (3) To modify an advisory opinion means that the advisory opinion is amended, altered, or limited, and that the advisory opinion continues in full force and effect in modified form thereafter. The OIG will not proceed against the requestor under this part if such action was promptly, diligently, and in good faith modified in accordance with reasonable time frames established by the OIG after consultation with the requestor.",
